### Polling
Polling can be defined as a method, which performs periodic requests regardless of the data that exists in the transmission. The periodic requests are sent in a synchronous way. The client makes a periodic request in a specified time interval to the Server. The response of the server includes available data or some warning message in it.

- So basically normal http request are the based on Polling, which checks whether Any msg is coming  or not?

### Streaming
It is considered as the best option for real-time data transmission. The server keeps the connection open and active with the client until and unless the required data is being fetched. In this case, the connection is said to be open indefinitely. Streaming includes HTTP headers which increases the file size, increasing delay. This can be considered as a major drawback.

### AJAX
AJAX is based on Javascript's XmlHttpRequest Object. It is an abbreviated form of Asynchronous Javascript and XML. XmlHttpRequest Object allows execution of the Javascript without reloading the complete web page. AJAX sends and receives only a portion of the web page.


### Websocket 
Create connection and its bi directional, it remains open until task done
